Predicting and Estimating Crop Yields with Deep Learning

The application of deep learning techniques to train models for forecasting future outcomes are powerful and practical tools. Agriculture, a pivotal component of the global economy, necessitates a comprehensive understanding of worldwide crop yield as the human population continues to grow. This knowledge is crucial for tackling food security issues and mitigating the effects of climate change.

The prediction of crop yield stands out as a significant challenge in agriculture. Weather conditions (such as rainfall, temperature, etc.), pesticide usage, and precise historical data on crop yield play critical roles in making informed decisions related to agricultural risk management and future predictions.

For this project, we'll be using the Crop Yield Prediction Dataset to predict crop yields of the 10 most consumed crops in the world. We'll build out, tune and train different deep learning architectures such as the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict yield, utilizing data such as pesticide use, rainfall and temperature and features in our prediction. We will progress with the hyperparameter tuning of the most appropriate deep learning model architecture and ultimatly compare all of those model performances to the performance of machine learning models such as linear regression and random forest.
